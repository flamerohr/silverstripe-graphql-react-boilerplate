# SilverStripe GraphQL-React-Boilerplate
Help get started with GraphQL and React in SilverStripe by providing helpers and a standard build
 to get you hitting the ground running.

This relies on the GraphQL module built for SilverStripe, utilising the DataObject Scaffolding feature that
 is provided.

## Getting started:
Install the module with composer
```bash
composer require flamerohr/silverstripe-graphql-react-boilerplate
```

You'll then need to install node (version 6 or later) and yarn, please search for how and come back after.

## Note before use
This module presents a way to create a single page app within a section of your website.
It can be your entire website including the root index but for the purposes of demonstration,
 this keeps things more simple.

It's important to note that this is designed to be cherry picked apart, to choose the parts that you need
 quickly and easily to get started.
